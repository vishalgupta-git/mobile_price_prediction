# 📱 Mobile Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts mobile phone prices using multiple regression models. The best model is deployed via a **Streamlit** app for interactive price prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates different regression models to determine the most accurate one for predicting mobile phone prices. The selected model (Random Forest) is deployed using a user-friendly Streamlit UI.

- 📓 Training & analysis done in `notebook.ipynb`
- 🧠 Best model (`Random Forest`) saved as `best_rf.pkl`
- 📊 Preprocessing scaler saved as `scaler.pkl`
- 🌐 Web app built in `app.py`
- 🎨 Visual branding/image: `mobile.png`

## 🧠 Model Training Workflow

The training notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Training and comparing multiple models  
- Model evaluation  
- Saving the best model and scaler for deployment
